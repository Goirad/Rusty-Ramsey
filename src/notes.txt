TODO

Multithread get next size, should be fairly trivial
  Split up source vector into chunks and each thread appends
  their next size to a master list

Add a way to let clean_isos2 report back the current progress

Change channel dynamic to have update thread send a request for
update to each thread, which then return their current state


Idea for more efficient checking of isomorphisms

Pick a vertex, give it a color c1
  All of its neighbors get the color c2
    Continue assigning each uncolored vertex a new color (aka labeling distances from start vertex)
